### 2015 - Present | Mantis Tech
I started with [Mantis Tech](https://mantisx.com/) as the only iOS developer, writing objective-c, and swift, after our building out the initial iOS app, I was then asked to learn the ins and outs of Android development. They initially hired me because I had worked with them as an intern back in 2012 doing web development, and since then had done three or four Bluetooth Low Energy projects for various startups. For the last 5 years I have managed both the iOS and Android apps for our shooting performance system. In addition to objective-c, swift, and java, I have spent a lot of time writing python to do data analysis and training simple machine learning algorithms using Tensorflow and Keras. I've also worked on the user facing [data portal](https://train.mantisx.com/) written with Django.


### 2012-2015 LunchBox

While studying at BYU, I started an app called LunchBox, that would help students find free food on campus. It was wildly successful at accumulating users, helping people find free food, and building a cult following. It was less successful at making money. In addition to the apps, I had written dozens of Java and Python scripts to scrape Facebook and various event calendars to find these free food events.

### Other Projects of Note

**[DeckOfCardsApi.com](https://deckofcardsapi.com)** is an API I wrote in python/django mostly because I wanted to build a super easy API with no authentication that was dead simple to get started with. It did very well with the Hacker News community, and is my most popular project.

**SWMonkey.com** was a project to help people save money on their Southwest Airlines flights. Southwest Airlines has a "no fees" policy on all their flights, so if your flight drops in price, you can cancel, re-book, and save the difference. I built an app that would allow users to enter their flights; we would track the price for them and alert them if the price dropped.  They could then re-book and save money. Southwest sued. To resolve the litigation, we agreed to a consent judgment in favor of Southwest Airlines and to abide by the website terms and conditions.

**SelectStarFromMovies.com** was another project aimed at the HN crowd. (It's currently off-line; it did **not** hit the front page of HN, and my shared AWS EC2 instance was having issues with NGINX, so I decided to simplify my life). I had written some python code to scrape movie data from Netflix, IMDB and rotten tomatoes, and build up a database where users could write SQL statements to query the database. It was cool because you could answer questions like, "What are all the PG-13 comedies with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson that have a tomato score of more than 65 that are streaming on Netflix."

**[ComputerEngineeringForBabies.com](https://ComputerEngineeringForBabies.com/)**, built with vanilla Javascript. This site is actually just a landing page for a hardware project, a board book for babies that teaches basic digital gates through two buttons and an LED. I designed the PC boards in KiCad, programmed the microcontrollers with the Arduino IDE, and am currently waiting for the _final prototypes_ from Guangzhou China. I'm hoping to do a small run of 1,000 books through Kickstarter.

**[GraffExchange.com](https://www.graffexchange.com/)**, built with UIKit, this is an app that matches people practicing graffiti letters so that they can swap monikers for a sketch or two.

**[PistolStats.com](https://www.pistolstats.com/)** is currently a work in progress built with Python, Django, Vue.js and Vuetify. The idea is to build a comprehensive database with all sorts of stats for pistols. I started building this as a way to promote Mantis, but have put it on the back-burner as other projects have become more exciting for me.
